# Two_Character_Challenge_in_C
Coding challenge response for the hackerrank challenge "Two Characters" by nabila_ahmed, completed in C

Please go to hackerrank to get the actual problem in the same manner that it was presented to me.

This problem could have been solved easily in Python using sets, however, I could only use Java or C. Because I used Java on previous problems for the same challenge group, I chose C, figuring this was a chance to show my ability to take a step by step approach to show understanding of the problem and core software desing ideas. The result was pretty lengthy, as I tried to do as much as I could using the bare minimum provided in C language and design as I would for embedded software in the automotive industry.

There are certainly multiple to ways to code this. I ended up returning pointers for strings to stay organized.
